# Clicky Game
Clicky game is a React.js Memory game, that enables the users to click on an image to score a point. if they click on an image that they've already selected they lose the game. This version is a Game of Thrones edition, where you have to click on the game of thrones characters. After you select a character the character cards will randomly change to make it more difficult. If you click on the same character twice, the game is over and you can start over.
